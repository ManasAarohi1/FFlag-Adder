This will automatically apply the fflags in "ClientAppSettings.json" to all roblox versions, This is useful when using the vanilla roblox client instead of bootstrappers

The fflag list there previously is a premade list made to optimize roblox to its fullest to decrease CPU and RAM utilization

To apply custom fflags, Edit the "ClientAppSettings.json" with the fflags you desire.

You will have to rerun the script every time roblox updates as roblox will reset these fflags each time.

TUTORIAL 

Make sure you uninstall all bootstrappers and install the vanilla roblox client.

Run the bat file, If you would like to have a new set of fflags edit the .json file and paste your list.

Done!
